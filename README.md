<summary><strong>Requirements</strong></summary>

> Please make sure you have the following **modules installed** before using Integrity Box:

1) - [**Official Tricky Store**](https://github.com/5ec1cff/TrickyStore/releases) or [**TEE Simulator**](https://github.com/JingMatrix/TEESimulator/releases) (use any one)

2) - [**Zygisk Next**](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext/releases) or [**ReZygisk**](https://github.com/PerformanC/ReZygisk/releases) (use any one)


> - If you are using Google Pixel stock ROM, or if you want to use your custom ROM's inbuilt spoofing feature, you do not need Zygisk. Simply create a file or folder named `zygisk` in your internal storage `/sdcard/zygisk` (make sure the name is exactly lowercase), and then flash Integrity Box. This will disable all zygisk related components and grant you full CONTROL without any conflict

<summary><strong>FAQ</strong></summary>

- **What is IntegrityBox?**  
  A complete Play Integrity compatibility and system-signal management toolkit.

- **Who should use IntegrityBox?**  
  Rooted users and custom ROM users who care about Play Integrity reliability.

- **Why was IntegrityBox created?**  
  Honestly? It started because so many people were selling keyboxes and I thought, “this is bad, everyone should have access to this for free.” So I made a tool that just gives you keyboxes without paying a cent. Then, well… I kept adding stuff. I kept improving things, fixing bugs, adding new ways to spoof, hide, clean, and optimize. And before I knew it… it turned into a beast of a module, probably the most powerful Play Integrity Fix anyone’s ever seen. It has so many features now that even I sometimes forget half of them 😭. But yeah, that’s the story: started small, got greedy with features, and now it’s the one-stop solution for anyone who wants STRONG or DEVICE integrity without the headaches. Just flash & forget, no need to do anything manually.

- **Does IntegrityBox replace Play Integrity Fix/Fork module?**  
  Yes! Starting from v28, PIF is fully integrated into IntegrityBox. The module ID was changed to `playintegrityfix` to avoid conflicts, because honestly, using both at the same time doesn’t make sense. IntegrityBox now handles everything PIF did, plus all the extra features I’ve added along the way

<summary><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></summary>

Google Play Integrity has fully replaced SafetyNet and is now the only attestation system used by modern apps. It checks whether a device looks *trustworthy and close to a certified Android environment*. Because of this, failures are common on outdated, heavily modified, or poorly configured systems.

Play Integrity checks do **not** only look at root status. They evaluate multiple system signals, including ROM configuration, SELinux state, system hooks, and how Google services behave at runtime.

To reduce false negatives and improve reliability:

- **Use a ROM with SELinux set to `enforcing`.**  
  ROMs running in permissive mode are frequently flagged. Even if everything else looks fine, permissive SELinux alone can cause integrity checks to fail.

- **Keep Google Play Services and the Play Store fully up to date.**  
  Play Integrity relies on Play Services to perform attestation. Old or mismatched versions can break communication with Google’s servers and lead to unexpected failures.

- **Avoid system-level frameworks that hook core services.**  
  Xposed, LSPosed, or similar frameworks, especially modules that interact with Google Play Services or the Play Store, are a common cause of integrity failures. Even “harmless” hooks can be detected.

- **Minimize invasive system modifications.**  
  Changes such as aggressive build.prop spoofing, signature spoofing, or runtime code injection increase the likelihood of detection unless they are carefully handled.

- **Keep the system as close to stock behavior as possible.**  
  The closer your device behaves to a certified, unmodified Android environment, the more consistent Play Integrity results will be.

Play Integrity is stricter than older systems and is actively updated by Google. Passing checks today does not guarantee passing them forever, especially on custom ROMs. Treat integrity passing as something that requires maintenance, not a one-time setup.
